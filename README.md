# TV Show Finder

## About
TV Show Finder is based on, and intended for future use with
https://github.com/tvrenamer/tvrenamer

Rather than trying to figure out an entire episode, and renaming it for you, this is just focused on figuring out which show a file represents.  It allows a lot more interactivity.  Once you have confirmed the mapping between filename and TV series, it writes it out in a way that may be able to be used by TVRenamer in the future.
