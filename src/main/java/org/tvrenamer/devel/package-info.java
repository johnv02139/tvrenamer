/**
 * The "devel" sub-package is for code which may not really be part of the
 * TVRenamer program, and might not be accessible from the UI at all, but which
 * is useful while doing development.
 *
 * Then again, it might be accessible.  Some of it could turn out to be useful
 * to end users.
 *
 * As presently constructed, these files would be included in an application.
 * But this branch is in the early stages of development.  We could eventually
 * choose to move these files, or incorporate them, or configure launch4j to
 * specifically exclude this package, etc., etc.  It doesn't need to all be
 * figured out now.
